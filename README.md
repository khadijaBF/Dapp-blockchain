## 📄 Smart Contract Overview

The smart contract manages:

* Product listings (ID, name, price, seller)
* Purchase operations with payment validation
* Ownership transfer and purchase history

All interactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and auditability.

---

## 📌 Security Measures

* Users must connect wallets to perform transactions
* Payment logic embedded in smart contracts
* No centralized server – only frontend and blockchain
